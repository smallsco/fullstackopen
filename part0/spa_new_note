note over browser:
1. User clicks "Save" with the text "asdf" in the
note field.
2. The default behavior of the save button is
suppressed.
3. The current timestamp is captured, and
serialized to JSON alongside the new note text:
{content: "asdf", date: "2020-04-05T00:08:37.840Z"}
4. The new note and date are added to the notes
array.
5. The redrawNotes() function is called, which
removes all existing notes from the DOM and then
adds them back from the notes array.
6. The sendToServer() function is called, which
initiates a POST request using the serialized JSON
to save the new note to the server.
